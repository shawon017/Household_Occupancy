# Machine Learning for Household Occupancy Prediction

### UK DRI Care Research and Technology Centre Data Engineering Task

The objective here is to build a simple model that can predict whether a household is single or multiple occupancy using data from motion sensors installed in the home. This data is available as an SQLite database here. Your model should be trained using features derived from the sensor data.
